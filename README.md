# Spam-Message-Classification

The aim of this project is to classify messages as "Spam" or "Ham(Not Spam)".

It uses Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to do this.

The input data is not dynamic and is taken from a dataset.

To classify and predict if the message is Spam or Ham, I've built two models, one using the Random Forest algorithm and the other using the Support Vector Machine algorithm.

The accuracy achieved using the Random Forest algorithm is slightly better than that of the Support Vector Machine algorithm. 

The biggest challenge that I encountered is that both the models do not identify subtle or all kinds of spam messages.

To overcome this, some improvements that can be made in the future are:
1. To take real-time data or dynamic data as input.
2. To build models using more algorithms.

Programming Language: Python

Environment: Google Colab
